## Project Motivation

This project was initially suggested by our course instructor to build a basic personal finance tracker. However, our motivation grew stronger after observing how financial challenges affect students in real life. Many students living independently on limited incomes struggled to manage money effectively.

The project was inspired by the real need for a tool that promotes better financial habits. By allowing users to track income, expenses, and savings, the app helps people gain clearer understanding of their financial health. The savings section was specifically added to encourage financial discipline, separating saved amounts from daily spending.

Our goal is to make personal finance less overwhelming and more manageable for everyone.
